# TauRayTrace
Ray Tracing desktop app built with Tauri, Rust, and HTML/JS Canvas. Based on Gabriel Gambetta's Computer Graphics from Scratch


## Future Goals and/or Roadmap:

- Move all methods one by one to the Rust side
- have frontend only hold variables and html5 canvas
- Frontend talks to the compiled Rust engine, Rust engine does heavy processing/memory intensive tasks
